Tesla is investigating production bottlenecks and they need your help to extract the relevant data. Write a query to determine which parts have begun the assembly process but are not yet finished.

Assumptions:

    parts_assembly table contains all parts currently in production, each at varying stages of the assembly process.
    An unfinished part is one that lacks a finish_date.
